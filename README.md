### "Enough" Python


There are plenty of soup-to-nuts Python tutorials aimed at people who are just starting programming, and want to be
experts at Python.  But what if you sort of already know other programming languages, and need a quick bootstrap for the
Python language so you can start hacking right away?  That is what this tutorial is for.

This is a Python quickstart for people who already know to program in one or more other languages, with just enough
about Python syntax so that you can dive in and start hacking right away.

Work through this tutorial by looking at the source files in the following (suggested) sequence, reading the commments
and executing snippets of code in your favorite editor. I will flesh this tutorial out a bit more in the future, and
provide resources on how to (quickly) set up an editor and execution environment.

1. Arguments
2. Decorators
3. Tuples & Lists
4. Sets
5. Classes
6. Inheritance
7. Importing & Modules
